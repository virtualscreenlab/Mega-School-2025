Mega-School-2025 practical task

1) Access the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and obtain the 3D structure of hnRNP A2B1 
(PDB ID: 5HO4). Extract its FASTA sequence file.

2) Access UniProt and download the canonical FASTA sequence for hnRNP A2B1. 
(Do not use PyMOL for this step).

3) Extract the list of deleterious mutations from the following publication:
Dutta, K., et al. (2024). "Analyzing the Effects of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms on 
hnRNPA2/B1 Protein Stability and Function: Insights for Anticancer Therapeutic Design." 
ACS Omega, 9(5), 5485–5495.

4) Access the PredictSNP web server to calculate the expected accuracy score (in %) for 
analyzed mutations. 
(Reference: Bendl, J., et al. (2014). "PredictSNP: Robust and accurate consensus 
classifier for prediction of disease-related mutations." PLoS Computational Biology, 
10(1), e1003440.)

5) Determine the SNP type (neutral or deleterious) for the specified mutations in 
hnRNP A2B1. 

6) https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11922 (SNPs in hnRNP A/B family) or COSMIC database
